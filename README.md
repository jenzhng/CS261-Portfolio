# CS261-Project

Project was designed to showcase our understanding of data structures by implmenting a HashMap with chaining to handle collisions. Skeleton code was provided including for the very basic hashing functions, the dynamic array, and singly-linked-list data structure to build off of.  Functions implemented:
- empty_buckets()
- table_load()
- clear()
- put()
- contains_key()
- get()
- remove()
- resize_table()
- get_keys()
